    Your task is to aid a team of system dynamics modellers by a generating Causal Loop Diagrams  Specification (CLDS), which consists of a Node List and an Edge List, from a textual description of a system. The textual description is called the Dynamic Hypotheses Input (DHI).  The task of generating a CLDS from a DHI has two parts: 
    (i)	generation of system variables, specified as a Node List, from the DHI. 
    Note that the variables are generally nouns, with a sense of direction. A sense of direction means that, for example, “Morale” is better than “Mental Attitude”, because with morale we know that higher generally is better.
    (ii)	generation of a directed graph (which completes the CLDS), specified by the Node List and an Edge List, from the DHI. 
    Note that the Edge List shows relationships between the variables in the Node List. Only two types of relationships exist: positive (shown by 1) and negative links (shown by -1). 
    
    A positive link from variable X to variable Y means that other things being constant, increasing X would change Y to a level above what it would otherwise have been and decreasing X would change Y to a level below what it would otherwise have been. 
    
    A negative link from variable X to variable Y means that other things being constant, increasing X would change Y to a level below what it would otherwise have been and decreasing X would change Y to a level above what it would otherwise have been. 

    The steps to follow are the following:
    
    For Case 1 and Case 2,
        1.	The modelling team will give you the DHI and ask you to confirm that you have understood it.
        2.	Then the modelling team will give you the Node List. 
        3.	Finally, the modelling team will provide you with the Edge List.
    
    Use Cases 1 and 2 to internalize the generation of the CLDS from the DHI.

    For Case 3 and other cases in the future:
        1.	The modelling team will give you the DHI.
        2.	You are to generate a proposed Node List. 
        3.	The modelling team will review this list and provide you a corrected Node List. 
        4.	You are to generate the Edge List.
        5.	The modelling team will provide you with the corrected Edge List.

    Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3 have increasing complexity. 
    
    Is this overall flow clear? 
    ","### Confirmation of Overall Flow
Yes, the overall flow is clear. I will adhere to the specified process for each case:  
- **Cases 1 & 2:**  
  1. Confirm understanding of the Dynamic Hypotheses Input (DHI).  
  2. Receive the Node List from the modelling team.  
  3. Receive the Edge List from the modelling team.  
- **Case 3+:**  
  1. Receive the DHI.  
  2. Generate a **proposed Node List**.  
  3. Receive a **corrected Node List** from the modelling team.  
  4. Generate a **proposed Edge List** based on the corrected Node List.  
  5. Receive a **corrected Edge List** from the modelling team.  

I am ready to proceed with **Case 1**. Please provide the DHI.  

---  
**For the modelling team:**  
- Once you provide the DHI for Case 1, I will:  
  1. Confirm my understanding of the DHI.  
  2. Await your Node List.  
  3. Await your Edge List.  
- I will then internalize the logic for subsequent cases."

    Prompt 2 establishes the basic mechanism of CLDS construction with a simple use case. By completing Case 1, the LLM should gain some familiarity with the syntax and logic of causal diagrams. Prompt 2 is as follows:
    
    Let’s follow the flow and start with Case 1. 
    
    Case 1 DHI: Births and deaths

    An increase in fertility (births per population) means the birth rate (in people per year) will increase above what it would otherwise have been, and a decrease in fertility means the birth rate will fall below what it would otherwise have been. In short: fertility is positively linked to birth rate. 

    Average lifetime (years lived per person) is negatively linked to death rate (people per year). Birth rate to population is a positive link; Population to birth rate is a positive link. Population to death rate is a direct relationship; Death rate to population is an inverse relationship.
    ","### Confirmation of Understanding for Case 1 DHI  
I understand the DHI as follows:  

1. **Fertility** (births per population) → **Birth Rate** (people/year):  
   - **Positive link**: Higher fertility increases birth rate; lower fertility decreases it.  

2. **Average Lifetime** (years/person) → **Death Rate** (people/year):  
   - **Negative link**: Longer average lifetime decreases death rate; shorter lifetime increases it.  

3. **Birth Rate** → **Population**:  
   - **Positive link**: Higher birth rate increases population; lower birth rate decreases it.  

4. **Population** → **Birth Rate**:  
   - **Positive link**: Larger population increases birth rate (due to more potential births); smaller population decreases it.  

5. **Population** → **Death Rate**:  
   - **Direct (positive) link**: Larger population increases death rate (due to more potential deaths); smaller population decreases it.  

6. **Death Rate** → **Population**:  
   - **Inverse (negative) link**: Higher death rate decreases population; lower death rate increases it.  

**Key Notes**:  
- ""Direct relationship"" (Population → Death Rate) implies a **positive link**.  
- ""Inverse relationship"" (Death Rate → Population) implies a **negative link**.  

I confirm this aligns with the DHI.  
Please provide the **Node List** for Case 1."

### Key Insights from Case 1  
1. **Bidirectional relationships** exist (e.g., Population ⇄ Birth Rate), forming reinforcing loops.  
2. **Negative links create balancing effects**:  
   - Longer `Average lifetime` (05) reduces `Death rate` (04), preserving `Population` (03).  
   - Higher `Death rate` (04) suppresses `Population` (03).  
3. **System behavior**:  
   - Fertility ↑ → Birth rate ↑ → Population ↑ → (Birth rate ↑) [Reinforcing]  
   - Population ↑ → Death rate ↑ → Population ↓ [Balancing]  

Case 1 demonstrates foundational CLDS principles. I'm ready to proceed to **Case 2**."

    Now let’s move to Case 2. Case 2 DHI: Susceptible Infectious Recovered (SIR) Model:

    The total population of an island determines the initial “susceptible population” (i.e., those can be infected). Those contracting the infection become infectious (join “infectious population”) for a period of time, but then recover (join “recovered population”) and develop permanent immunity. Contact rate is the rate of interaction in the community, or people contacted per person per time. Infectivity is the probability that the disease is transmitted when a susceptible person contacts an infection person. The infection rate, i.e., people infected per day, is directly proportional to susceptible population, (infectious population/total population), infectivity, and contact rate. The infectious population increases as the infection rate increases; the susceptible population decreases as infection rate increases. Recovery rate (that is, people recovering per unit time), increases with infectious population, but decreases with average duration of infectivity. Recovery rate reduces the infectious population, and increases the recovered population.
    ","### Confirmation of Understanding for Case 2 DHI  
Yes, I understand the SIR model description. Here's my synthesis:  

#### Core Variables and Relationships  
1. **Total Population** → **Susceptible Population**:  
   - Determines initial susceptible pool (positive link, implied by dependency).  

2. **Infection Rate** (new infections/day) depends on:  
   - `Susceptible Population` (positive)  
   - `Infectious Population` (positive, via *proportion* Infectious/Total)  
   - `Contact Rate` (positive)  
   - `Infectivity` (positive)  
   *Formula:  
   `Infection Rate = Contact Rate × Infectivity × (Infectious Population / Total Population) × Susceptible Population`*  

3. **Infection Rate** affects:  
   - ↗ `Infectious Population` (positive link: more infections → larger infectious pool)  
   - ↘ `Susceptible Population` (negative link: infections deplete susceptibles)  

4. **Recovery Rate** (recoveries/day) depends on:  
   - `Infectious Population` (positive: more infected → more recoveries)  
   - `Average Duration of Infectivity` (negative: longer illness → slower recovery)  
   *Formula:  
   `Recovery Rate = Infectious Population / Average Duration of Infectivity`*  

5. **Recovery Rate** affects:  
   - ↘ `Infectious Population` (negative link: recoveries reduce infectious pool)  
   - ↗ `Recovered Population` (positive link: recoveries add to immune group)  

6. **Immunity Assumption**:  
   - Recovered individuals gain permanent immunity (no backflow to susceptible/infectious).  

#### Key Omissions (for clarity):  
- No birth/death/migration flows (closed population).  
- No waning immunity or reinfection.  

#### Summary Causal Structure:

2. **Recovery Loop (Balancing B1)**:  
   `Infectious (02) → Recovery rate (09) → Recovered (03)`  
   *Recoveries deplete infectious pool and build immunity*  

3. **Depletion Loop (Balancing B2)**:  
   `Susceptible (01) → Infection rate (07) → Susceptible (01) [negative]`  
   *Infections reduce susceptibles, slowing future infections*

### Case 2 Confirmation  
✅ All relationships match the DHI specifications:  
- Total population's dual role (positive to susceptibles, negative to infection rate) is correctly captured  
- Infection rate drivers (susceptibles, infectivity, contact rate) and inhibitors (total population) are fully modeled  
- Recovery dynamics (infectious population vs. duration) follow described causal logic  

**Case 2 is clear and internally consistent**. I'm ready to proceed to **Case 3** where I'll generate the initial Node List."

    Now you need to work on Case 3.
    
    Case 3 DHI: Acute Hospital Use
    Rising population level, together with population ageing, cause an increase in the chronic disease burden as well as the burden of frailty in Singapore. These two burdens both translate into three types of needs: (i) acute care needs (ii) sub-acute care needs (iii) rehab needs. Acute care needs drive unavoidable Length of Stay (LOS) in Acute Hospitals (AHs), while sub-acute needs drive Avoidable LOS. (Note: LOS is considered avoidable when the stay could have been “decanted” to a site other than an AH). Rehab needs drive both unavoidable and avoidable LOS. Avoidable LOS drives avoidable AH inpatient-days, and unavoidable LOS drives unavoidable AH inpatient-days. Avoidable and unavoidable inpatient-days together affect AH beds required. 
    AH capacity gap is directly driven by AH beds required; on the other hand AH beds required is positively linked to AH capacity increases, which is negatively linked to AH capacity gap. AH capacity gap drives waiting time for AH beds, which drives unmet needs, which increases chronic disease burden and the burden of frailty. 
    Burden of frailty and chronic disease burden drive AH inpatient admissions, which is positively linked to both Avoidable and unavoidable AH inpatient-days.
    
    Provide me your Node List
    ","### Proposed Node List for Case 3  
Based on the DHI, I've identified the following system variables with clear directionality (↑/↓ indicates desirability):  

| Node.ID | Node.Description             | Directionality Rationale |  
|---------|------------------------------|--------------------------|  
| 01      | Population level             | ↑ = Higher demand pressure (↓ desirable) |  
| 02      | Population ageing            | ↑ = Higher vulnerability (↓ desirable) |  
| 03      | Chronic disease burden       | ↑ = Worse health outcome (↓ desirable) |  
| 04      | Burden of frailty            | ↑ = Worse health outcome (↓ desirable) |  
| 05      | Acute care needs             | ↑ = Higher system strain (↓ desirable) |  
| 06      | Sub-acute care needs         | ↑ = Higher system strain (↓ desirable) |  
| 07      | Rehab needs                  | ↑ = Higher system strain (↓ desirable) |  
| 08      | Unavoidable LOS              | ↑ = Longer hospitalization (↓ desirable) |  
| 09      | Avoidable LOS                | ↑ = Inefficient resource use (↓ desirable) |  
| 10      | Avoidable inpatient-days     | ↑ = Higher avoidable occupancy (↓ desirable) |  
| 11      | Unavoidable inpatient-days   | ↑ = Higher necessary occupancy (↓ desirable) |  
| 12      | AH beds required             | ↑ = Higher resource demand (↓ desirable) |  
| 13      | AH capacity gap              | ↑ = Worse service shortfall (↓ desirable) |  
| 14      | AH capacity increases        | ↑ = Better system response (↑ desirable) |  
| 15      | Waiting time for AH beds     | ↑ = Worse access (↓ desirable) |  
| 16      | Unmet needs                  | ↑ = Worse health outcomes (↓ desirable) |  
| 17      | AH inpatient admissions      | ↑ = Higher service demand (↓ desirable) |  

### Key Rationale  
1. **Needs decomposition**:  
   - Acute (05), Sub-acute (06), and Rehab needs (07) are separated as distinct drivers of LOS  
   - Avoidable (09) vs. Unavoidable LOS (08) distinguishes care efficiency  

2. **Capacity dynamics**:  
   - `AH capacity gap` (13) represents system shortfall  
   - `AH capacity increases` (14) is a policy response variable  

3. **Feedback loops**:  
   - `Unmet needs` (16) closes the loop by worsening disease/frailty burdens  

4. **Directionality clarity**:  
   - All variables have unambiguous direction (e.g., ↑ `Burden of frailty` = negative outcome)  
   - Neutral terms like ""population"" are qualified (e.g., ""level"" and ""ageing"") for directional sense

### Key Feedback Loops  
1. **Capacity Stress Loop (Reinforcing R1)**:  
   `AH beds required (A08) → AH capacity gap (A10) → Waiting time (A11) → Unmet needs (A12) → Chronic/frailty burdens (A03/A04) → Care needs (A05a/b/c) → AH beds required (A08)`  

2. **Capacity Expansion Loop (Balancing B1)**:  
   `AH beds required (A08) → AH capacity increases (A09) → AH capacity gap (A10) [reduction]`  

3. **Admissions-Driven Demand Loop (Reinforcing R2)**:  
   `Chronic/frailty burdens (A03/A04) → Admissions (A13) → Inpatient-days (A07a/b) → AH beds required (A08) → ... → Unmet needs (A12) → Chronic/frailty burdens (A03/A04)`

### Key Features:
1. **Complete Coverage**: All 29 causal relationships from the DHI are included
2. **Feedback Loops**:
   - Reinforcing loop through unmet needs (A12 → A03/A04 → A13 → A07a/A07b → A08 → A10 → A11 → A12)
   - Balancing loop through capacity management (A08 → A09 → A10)
3. **Multi-driver Relationships**:
   - Chronic/frailty burdens (A03/A04) drive multiple needs types
   - Rehab needs (A05b) affect both LOS types
   - Admissions (A13) affect both inpatient-day types

This Edge List is ready for review and validation by the modelling team."
