    Your task is to aid a team of system dynamics modellers by a generating Causal Loop Diagrams  Specification (CLDS), which consists of a Node List and an Edge List, from a textual description of a system. The textual description is called the Dynamic Hypotheses Input (DHI).  The task of generating a CLDS from a DHI has two parts: 
    (i)	generation of system variables, specified as a Node List, from the DHI. 
    Note that the variables are generally nouns, with a sense of direction. A sense of direction means that, for example, “Morale” is better than “Mental Attitude”, because with morale we know that higher generally is better.
    (ii)	generation of a directed graph (which completes the CLDS), specified by the Node List and an Edge List, from the DHI. 
    Note that the Edge List shows relationships between the variables in the Node List. Only two types of relationships exist: positive (shown by 1) and negative links (shown by -1). 
    
    A positive link from variable X to variable Y means that other things being constant, increasing X would change Y to a level above what it would otherwise have been and decreasing X would change Y to a level below what it would otherwise have been. 
    
    A negative link from variable X to variable Y means that other things being constant, increasing X would change Y to a level below what it would otherwise have been and decreasing X would change Y to a level above what it would otherwise have been. 

    The steps to follow are the following:
    
    For Case 1 and Case 2,
        1.	The modelling team will give you the DHI and ask you to confirm that you have understood it.
        2.	Then the modelling team will give you the Node List. 
        3.	Finally, the modelling team will provide you with the Edge List.
    
    Use Cases 1 and 2 to internalize the generation of the CLDS from the DHI.

    For Case 3 and other cases in the future:
        1.	The modelling team will give you the DHI.
        2.	You are to generate a proposed Node List. 
        3.	The modelling team will review this list and provide you a corrected Node List. 
        4.	You are to generate the Edge List.
        5.	The modelling team will provide you with the corrected Edge List.

    Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3 have increasing complexity. 
    
    Is this overall flow clear? 
    ","Yes, I understand the overall flow clearly. Let me summarize to confirm:

**My Task:** Generate Causal Loop Diagram Specifications (CLDS) from Dynamic Hypotheses Input (DHI)

**Key Components:**
- **Node List**: System variables (nouns with directional sense, e.g., ""Morale"" where higher = better)
- **Edge List**: Relationships between variables
  - Positive links (1): X↑ → Y↑ or X↓ → Y↓
  - Negative links (-1): X↑ → Y↓ or X↓ → Y↑

**Process Flow:**

**Cases 1 & 2 (Learning Phase):**
1. Receive DHI → I confirm understanding
2. Receive Node List from team
3. Receive Edge List from team
(I internalize the pattern of CLDS generation)

**Case 3+ (Generation Phase):**
1. Receive DHI
2. I generate proposed Node List
3. Receive corrected Node List from team
4. I generate Edge List
5. Receive corrected Edge List from team

**Complexity:** Increases from Case 1 → Case 2 → Case 3

I'm ready to begin with Case 1 when you provide the DHI."

    Prompt 2 establishes the basic mechanism of CLDS construction with a simple use case. By completing Case 1, the LLM should gain some familiarity with the syntax and logic of causal diagrams. Prompt 2 is as follows:
    
    Let’s follow the flow and start with Case 1. 
    
    Case 1 DHI: Births and deaths

    An increase in fertility (births per population) means the birth rate (in people per year) will increase above what it would otherwise have been, and a decrease in fertility means the birth rate will fall below what it would otherwise have been. In short: fertility is positively linked to birth rate. 

    Average lifetime (years lived per person) is negatively linked to death rate (people per year). Birth rate to population is a positive link; Population to birth rate is a positive link. Population to death rate is a direct relationship; Death rate to population is an inverse relationship.
    ","I confirm that I have understood the Case 1 DHI about births and deaths. 

The system describes:
- Fertility affecting birth rate (positive relationship)
- Average lifetime affecting death rate (negative relationship)
- Birth rate and population affecting each other (positive both ways)
- Population and death rate relationships (positive from population to death rate, negative from death rate to population)

This appears to be a basic population dynamics model with feedback loops between population size, births, and deaths.

I'm ready to receive the Node List for Case 1."

    Prompt 3 provides the LLM with the Node and Edge Lists for Case 1 as follows:

    Case 1 Node List
    Node.ID,	Node.Description
    01,	Fertility
    02,	Birth rate
    03,	Population
    04,	Death rate
    05,	Average lifetime

    Case 1 Edges List

    03,	02,	1
    03,	04,	1
    04,	03,	-1
    05,	04,	-1

    Is Case 1 clear? 

    ","Yes, Case 1 is clear. I can see how the DHI translates to the CLDS:

**Node List** captures the 5 key variables:
- Fertility (births per population)
- Birth rate (people per year)
- Population
- Death rate (people per year)
- Average lifetime (years lived per person)

**Edge List** shows the relationships:
- 01→02 (Fertility→Birth rate): 1 (positive)
- 02→03 (Birth rate→Population): 1 (positive)
- 03→02 (Population→Birth rate): 1 (positive)
- 03→04 (Population→Death rate): 1 (positive)
- 04→03 (Death rate→Population): -1 (negative)
- 05→04 (Average lifetime→Death rate): -1 (negative)

I can see two feedback loops:
1. A reinforcing loop: Population → Birth rate → Population
2. A balancing loop: Population → Death rate → Population

The structure matches the DHI description perfectly. I'm ready for Case 2."
4,"
    Now let’s move to Case 2. Case 2 DHI: Susceptible Infectious Recovered (SIR) Model:

    The total population of an island determines the initial “susceptible population” (i.e., those can be infected). Those contracting the infection become infectious (join “infectious population”) for a period of time, but then recover (join “recovered population”) and develop permanent immunity. Contact rate is the rate of interaction in the community, or people contacted per person per time. Infectivity is the probability that the disease is transmitted when a susceptible person contacts an infection person. The infection rate, i.e., people infected per day, is directly proportional to susceptible population, (infectious population/total population), infectivity, and contact rate. The infectious population increases as the infection rate increases; the susceptible population decreases as infection rate increases. Recovery rate (that is, people recovering per unit time), increases with infectious population, but decreases with average duration of infectivity. Recovery rate reduces the infectious population, and increases the recovered population.
    ","I confirm that I have understood the Case 2 DHI about the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) Model.

The system describes:
- Total population determines initial susceptible population
- Disease transmission flow: Susceptible → Infectious → Recovered (with permanent immunity)
- Key factors affecting infection rate:
  - Susceptible population (positive effect)
  - Infectious population/Total population ratio (positive effect)
  - Infectivity (probability of transmission, positive effect)
  - Contact rate (people contacted per person per time, positive effect)
- Infection rate increases infectious population and decreases susceptible population
- Recovery dynamics:
  - Recovery rate increases with infectious population (positive)
  - Recovery rate decreases with average duration of infectivity (negative)
  - Recovery rate reduces infectious population and increases recovered population

This is a classic epidemiological model showing how diseases spread through a population with feedback loops between the different population states.

    ","Yes, Case 2 is clear. I can see how the SIR model DHI translates to the CLDS:

**Node List** captures the 9 key variables:
- Three population states: Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered
- Total population
- Disease parameters: Infectivity, Contact rate, Avg duration of infectivity
- Flow rates: Infection rate, Recovery rate

**Edge List** analysis:
- **To Infection rate (07)**:
  - 01→07: 1 (Susceptible population increases infection rate)
  - 02→07: 1 (Infectious population increases infection rate)
  - 04→07: -1 (Total population decreases infection rate - this represents the dilution effect)
  - 05→07: 1 (Infectivity increases infection rate)
  - 06→07: 1 (Contact rate increases infection rate)

- **From Infection rate**:
  - 07→01: -1 (Infection rate depletes susceptible population)
  - 07→02: 1 (Infection rate increases infectious population)

- **Recovery dynamics**:
  - 02→09: 1 (More infectious people means more recoveries)
  - 08→09: -1 (Longer infectivity duration means slower recovery rate)
  - 09→02: -1 (Recovery depletes infectious population)
  - 09→03: 1 (Recovery increases recovered population)

- **Initial condition**:
  - 04→01: 1 (Total population determines initial susceptible population)

I notice the edge 04→07 (-1) cleverly captures the ""(infectious population/total population)"" ratio effect mentioned in the DHI - as total population increases, the proportion of infectious people decreases, reducing infection rate.

I'm ready for Case 3 where I'll generate the lists myself."

    Now you need to work on Case 3.
    
    Case 3 DHI: Acute Hospital Use
    Rising population level, together with population ageing, cause an increase in the chronic disease burden as well as the burden of frailty in Singapore. These two burdens both translate into three types of needs: (i) acute care needs (ii) sub-acute care needs (iii) rehab needs. Acute care needs drive unavoidable Length of Stay (LOS) in Acute Hospitals (AHs), while sub-acute needs drive Avoidable LOS. (Note: LOS is considered avoidable when the stay could have been “decanted” to a site other than an AH). Rehab needs drive both unavoidable and avoidable LOS. Avoidable LOS drives avoidable AH inpatient-days, and unavoidable LOS drives unavoidable AH inpatient-days. Avoidable and unavoidable inpatient-days together affect AH beds required. 
    AH capacity gap is directly driven by AH beds required; on the other hand AH beds required is positively linked to AH capacity increases, which is negatively linked to AH capacity gap. AH capacity gap drives waiting time for AH beds, which drives unmet needs, which increases chronic disease burden and the burden of frailty. 
    Burden of frailty and chronic disease burden drive AH inpatient admissions, which is positively linked to both Avoidable and unavoidable AH inpatient-days.
    
    Provide me your Node List
    ","Based on the Case 3 DHI about Acute Hospital Use, here is my proposed Node List:

**Case 3 Node List**

| 13 | AH capacity gap |
| 14 | AH capacity increases |
| 15 | Waiting time for AH beds |
| 16 | Unmet needs |
| 17 | AH inpatient admissions |

The variables capture:
- Population drivers (level, ageing)
- Disease burdens (chronic disease, frailty)
- Care needs (acute, sub-acute, rehab)
- Length of stay categories (avoidable, unavoidable)
- Hospital metrics (inpatient-days, beds required, capacity gap, waiting time)
- System feedback (unmet needs, admissions)"

    ","Thank you for the corrected Node List. I see the key differences:
- Node IDs use alphanumeric format (A01, A02, etc.)
- ""Population level"" → ""Population""
- Care needs are split into three distinct nodes (A05a, A05b, A05c)
- LOS and inpatient-days are split into 'a' and 'b' variants for unavoidable/avoidable
- Total of 17 nodes with clear labeling

Now I'll generate the Edge List based on the DHI and this corrected Node List:

- Disease burdens create care needs
- Care needs drive appropriate LOS types
- LOS drives inpatient-days
- Inpatient-days determine beds required
- Capacity dynamics and feedback loops through unmet needs
- Admissions pathway from disease burdens to inpatient-days"
