The task of generating a CLDS from a DHI has two parts: \n    (i)\tgeneration of system variables, specified as a Node List, from the DHI. \n    Note that the variables are generally nouns, with a sense of direction. A sense of direction means that, for example, “Morale” is better than “Mental Attitude”, because with morale we know that higher generally is better.\n    (ii)\tgeneration of a directed graph (which completes the CLDS), specified by the Node List and an Edge List, from the DHI. \n    Note that the Edge List shows relationships between the variables in the Node List. Only two types of relationships exist: positive (shown by 1) and negative links (shown by -1). \n    \n    A positive link from variable X to variable Y means that other things being constant, increasing X would change Y to a level above what it would otherwise have been and decreasing X would change Y to a level below what it would otherwise have been. \n    \n    A negative link from variable X to variable Y means that other things being constant, increasing X would change Y to a level below what it would otherwise have been and decreasing X would change Y to a level above what it would otherwise have been. \n\n    The steps to follow are the following:\n    \n    For Case 1 and Case 2,\n        1.\tThe modelling team will give you the DHI and ask you to confirm that you have understood it.\n        2.\tThen the modelling team will give you the Node List. \n        3.\tFinally, the modelling team will provide you with the Edge List.\n    \n    Use Cases 1 and 2 to internalize the generation of the CLDS from the DHI.\n\n    For Case 3 and other cases in the future:\n        1.\tThe modelling team will give you the DHI.\n        2.\tYou are to generate a proposed Node List. \n        3.\tThe modelling team will review this list and provide you a corrected Node List. \n        4.\tYou are to generate the Edge List.\n        5.\tThe modelling team will provide you with the corrected Edge List.\n\n    Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3 have increasing complexity. \n    \n    Is this overall flow clear? \n    ",

Case 2 DHI: Susceptible Infectious Recovered (SIR) Model:\n\n    The total population of an island determines the initial “susceptible population” (i.e., those can be infected). Those contracting the infection become infectious (join “infectious population”) for a period of time, but then recover (join “recovered population”) and develop permanent immunity. Contact rate is the rate of interaction in the community, or people contacted per person per time. Infectivity is the probability that the disease is transmitted when a susceptible person contacts an infection person. The infection rate, i.e., people infected per day, is directly proportional to susceptible population, (infectious population/total population), infectivity, and contact rate. The infectious population increases as the infection rate increases; the susceptible population decreases as infection rate increases.

(A08) → AH capacity increases (A09) → AH capacity gap (A10) [reduction]`  \n\n3. **Admissions-Driven Demand Loop (Reinforcing R2)**:  \n   `Chronic/frailty burdens (A03/A04) → Admissions (A13) → Inpatient-days (A07a/b) → AH beds required (A08) → ... → Unmet needs (A12) → Chronic/frailty burdens (A03/A04)`  \n\n**Next Step**:  \nPlease review and provide the *corrected Edge List* for Case
